# FPS-Game
In-development prototype of basic FPS game using the Unity engine. 

Originally started as a tutorial on how to program a custom character controller, then has been built upon from there.

Assets are either quickly created by myself or used from the Unity asset store.

All code in this project is of own original creation except for:
SimplePool.cs -- provided by Martin "quill18" Glaude under CC0 license
Some code in FirstPersonController -- also provided by Martin "quill18" Glaude in a tutorial, marked as such
